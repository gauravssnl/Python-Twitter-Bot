# Python-Twitter-Bot

1. To use Twitter bot you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. This bot uses tweepy module. You can install tweepy by using pip. To install tweepy, use this command:

```bash
$ pip install tweepy
```

2. Now you need to create a new application on Twitter. Either you can use your existing account or you can create a new one. Creating a new account for a bot is better so that your original Twitter account does not get banned. To create a new application on Twitter, open this URL in your browser:

    https://apps.twitter.com/

3. Fill all details required to create the new app. After that, click on "Key and Access Token" tab under app settings. You will get your app's Consumer Key (API Key, Consumer Secret (API Secret)). You also need to get Access Token and Access Token Secret of your app. We will use these valuse in next step. You need to generate Access Token for first time.

4. Edit `credentials.py` and copy-paste all your details carefully.

5. Now you can run `twitterbot_text.py` file to run bot which will tweet The Zen of Python texts by using this command:

```bash
$ python twitterbot_text.py 
```

6. You can also use any file instead of `sample.txt`. To do that you need to open `twitterbot_text.py` file and edit this line `my_file=open('sample.txt','r')` and enter your desired filename instead of `sample.txt`.

7. Enjoy the service of Twitter Bot which tweets texts of a file. You can also alter sleep time in script as you wish.

## Twitter bot which retweets, likes and follows

8. Use `twitterbot_retweet.py` file for a Twitter bot which retweets tweets based on particular hastags (script provided here use #python ), likes tweets and follows the user who tweeted it. Set your desired Bot settings such as `QUERY`,`LIKE`,`FOLLOW` in `config.py` file. To run `twitterbot_retweet.py` use this command:

```bash
$ python twitterbot_retweet.py
```

9. You can use any desired hastag (such as #javascipt). Just edit hastag '#python' in `config.py` file with whatever you want.

10. You can also edit code if you do not want your bot to follow users or you do not want your bot to like tweets.

11. You can also deploy Twitter bot on online based servers if you want to run the bot 24 hours continously. Take care of sleep/delay if you run bot the whole day. You should try to use large sleep time so that your account does not get banned.
